  <p>Hi! I am Edie Argueta and I live in New York City.   I am currently reinventing myself from a cab driver into a full stack developer. Quite literally, coding saved my life. After a less than desirable performance in law school, I was forced to realize that maybe law was not for me. It was a tough to accept and I fearfully asked myself “what now?”
  <br>
  <br>
  I began sinking under the waves of panic and despair, but then, a life preserver appeared! Someone recommended I apply to the CUNY Techworks program and I did. On the first day of class, I immediately fell in love with coding! It reignited my desire to learn. Coding returned to me what I was missing. It gave me a purpose.
